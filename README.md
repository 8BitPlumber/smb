# SMB & SMB2J Practice ROM

To keep settings, frame rules and stuff persistent; configure your game
system (emulator, PowerPAK, EverDrive etc.) to allow the SMB Practice ROM
battery-backed WRAM. Essentially, figure out how to make it so that you can
save in Zelda, power off the system, and load (without using save states). Then
do the same for the SMB Practice ROM.

**I'll describe more indepth about new features tomorrow. Right now I just want
it released.**

## Feature list
